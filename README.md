# Wood Species Identification Model

This project develops a machine learning model to identify wood species from images. It utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and several other libraries for data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Environment Setup

The project is developed on WSL Ubuntu 18.04 and uses Poetry for dependency management.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, install Poetry using the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install poetry
   ```
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   python3 -m poetry install
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found at [Hugging Face: Wood Species Identification Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LynBean/wood-species-identification).
